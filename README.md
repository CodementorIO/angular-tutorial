# AngularJS Chat App with Firebase

This tutorial will walk you through how to use AngularJS to build a simple chat app hosted on Firebase.
The app will be scaffolded by Yeoman's [gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) generator.

The tutorial is split into five steps. After finishing all these steps, your client should be able to end up with a live chat app!
Each finished step is tagged in the repo as you can see by using the command `$ git tag`.


# Step0: From the Start:

This is the starting point of this tutorial, which is simply the scaffolding result of `yeoman`.

# Step1: Warm up

In this step, you will build the basic UI elements of this chat app using static data.

A sample of the finished version of this step can be found [here](https://sample-projects.codementor.io/angular-tutorial/step1)

# Step2: Basic Control Flow with Local Data

In this step, we will add basic control flows using our local data.

A sample of the result of this step can be found [here](https://sample-projects.codementor.io/angular-tutorial/step2)

# Step3: Register/Login via Firebase

In this step, we will add register/login funcationality to the app using the [firebase SDK](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/guide/user-auth.html).

An example of the result of this step can be found [here](https://sample-projects.codementor.io/angular-tutorial/step3)


# Step4: Connect Data with Firebase
In this step, we will replace our in-memory mock data with the real one on firebase.

An example of the result of this step can be found [here](https://sample-projects.codementor.io/angular-tutorial/step4)

# Step5: Use different route to handle each user

In this step, we will assign a dedicated URL for each chat using [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router).
This way, we can stay at the same chat even after we refresh our browser.
